# Exercise-2
In this exercise, you'll practice using the `lappy()` function to apply functions and modify lists.

As in previous exercises, you should fork and clone this repository, follow the instructions in the `exercise.R` file, then `add` and `commit` your changes so that you can `push` them back up to GitHub.
